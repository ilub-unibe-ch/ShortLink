It is important that the rewrite_mod is enabled (should be already the case).

Add the rewrite to the end of the rewrite rules in the current VHost.conf

RewriteRule \^/shortlink/([a-zA-Z0-9-]+)?$ https://ilias.yourDomain/Customizing/global/plugins/Services/UIComponent/UserInterfaceHook/ShortLink/redirect.php?shortlink=$1 [L]

If you work on localhost add:

RewriteRule \^/shortlink/([a-zA-Z0-9-]+)?$ http://localhost:80/Customizing/global/plugins/Services/UIComponent/UserInterfaceHook/ShortLink/redirect.php?shortlink=$1 [L]
